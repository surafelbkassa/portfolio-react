          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm <strong>Surafel Belachew</strong>, a creative and dependable frontend(React) and backend(Golang) developer who turns ideas into scalable, user-friendly digital experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in Golang, JavaScript, React, and clean UI/UX. I care deeply about accessibility, responsive design, and building interfaces that just feel right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I'm always learning â€” AI, tech, design, or whatever challenges help me grow. Let's work together to build something great.
